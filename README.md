# Test Boost installation
To test if your C++ programs can access your Boost installation using CMake, simply run this project.
The `run.bash` file will create a build folder and compile your program in this folder.
The program will then automatically run and print the Boost version to the terminal.
To start over from scratch, run `clean.bash` before running `run.bash`.
